# Project Summary

This project explores how football match outcomes can be predicted more accurately by focusing on **team performance metrics rather than goals**.

Using the **Generalised Attacking Performance (GAP) rating system**, team attacking and defensive strengths are estimated for home and away matches. These ratings are then used to predict future match statistics and outcomes.

### Key Insights:
- Goals are highly unpredictable and influenced by luck
- Performance indicators such as **xG, shots on target, smart passes, and penalty-area actions** provide stronger signals
- GAP-predicted statistics outperform simple averages
- Combining observed and predicted performance metrics leads to more accurate probabilistic forecasts

### Outcome:
The research demonstrates that **evaluating teams based on attacking performance quality rather than goals scored** produces more reliable football match predictions.

This approach is valuable for:
- Sports analytics
- Betting models
- Team performance evaluation
- Recruitment & tactical analysis
